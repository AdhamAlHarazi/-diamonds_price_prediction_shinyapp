# Diamonds price prediction shinyapp

This repo contains the project's files for the shiny app that predicts the diamonds price, developed for the Coursera John Hopkins developing data products course in the data science specialization.
The app allows the user to enter the specification of the diamond like the carat weight, the cut quality, the color grade, and the clarity, then it computes the predicted price for this diamond after he/she hits the submit button.
